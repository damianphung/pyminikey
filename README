    - Supports range requests
    - 302 redirect to volume server
- {PUT, DELETE} /key
    - Blocks. 200 = written, anything else = nothing happened

./master -p 3000 /tmp/cacheddb/

### Start volume server
./volume -p 3001 /tmp/volume1 localhost:3000
./volume -p 3002 /tmp/volume1 localhost:3000

curl -L -X GET localhost:3000/key
